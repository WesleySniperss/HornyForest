Moonblades were named in part because of the moonstones found in the pommel of each sword but also for the moon elves that wielded them, with the only exception of the half-elf assassin, Arilyn Moonblade. According to Ethlando, the mage responsible for conception and creation of the largest collection of moonblades, the other elves, such as sylvan elves and sun elves were not prohibited from claiming a blade, it was just highly unlikely.

**History**

Each moonblade was tied to the elven bloodline that first claimed the blade and was passed from descendant to descendant until there were no worthier heirs. Every elf in the family had a choice to attempt to bond with the blade. If the elf chose to bond with the blade, they were subjected to the moonblade's bladerite in which the sword judged the character of the prospective wielder. The wielder was not only judged by his own character but also by the characters of all its previous wielders. With each new wielder the blade became harder to obtain by the next user. Any elf judged unworthy by the blade was subjected to the consequences of the bladerite, which usually resulted in immediate death by arcane fire. A claimed blade never bonded with an elf that did not carry the bloodline of the original family, making the blade's magics useless in the hands of anyone else. This moonblade was gifted the moon elves of Valania and tasked with finding a worthy wielder. 

The wielders of the moonblades also paid a cost — when they died, their life essence entered the moonblade, to become the source of its magic. Until the moonblade's purpose was fulfilled, the passage to Arvandor was delayed for all of the elven souls within.

Sentience

A **moonblade** is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 13. It has hearing and [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder’s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

###### Personality

Every **moonblade** seeks to defend elvenkind and servants of Sehanine. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose. The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.

If a **moonblade** has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.  
  

You gain a **+3**![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/6874920-enni-s-blade-of-the-dim-moon) bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit an undead, fiend, or a creature vulnerable to radiant damage, that creature takes an extra **2d10**![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/6874920-enni-s-blade-of-the-dim-moon) radiant damage. Eilistraee's Moonsword also scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Eilistraee's Moonsword also radiates a bright blue light in a radius of 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

While you hold the drawn sword, the sword sings constantly (and loudly) when unsheathed. The blade's song makes its wielder confident and immune to the fear.  
  
**Spellsong.** When casting a spell you may imbue it into a Spellsong as a bonus action, when doing so you replace all Verbal, Somatic, and Material components (valuing less than 50gp) with a song you perform. Creatures will not be able to discern the source of your spells, when imbued into a Spellsong. You may choose one creature affected by the spell to gain ownership of the spell as its caster, allowing them to maintain concentration on the spell.

- **Moonlight Slash:** When you attack with Eilistraee's Moonsword, you can choose to send out a wave of Moonlight energy with the slash. A crescent of arcane energy flies from the blade in a 30 ft long, 5 ft wide line in the direction you attacked. Any creature in the line must succeed a Dexterity Save equal to 8 + your spell casting modifier or Intelligence DC + your Proficiency modifier, taking **8d6**![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/6874920-enni-s-blade-of-the-dim-moon) radiant damage on failure and half as much on a success. The creature hit by the initial attack automatically fails its saving throw.
